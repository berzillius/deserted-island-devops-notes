# Deserted Island DevOps Notes

This repo contains my notes from the [Deserted Island DevOps tech conference](https://desertedisland.club) that was streamed on April 30, 2020. Over 7,000 people watched the stream on Twitch and there was a large amount of good conversation in the Twitch chat and the Discord server.

Feel free to add your own notes or edit mine via PR! The thoughts and initiatives that were shared during the conference absolutely deserve a wide audience. Let's help the world learn!
