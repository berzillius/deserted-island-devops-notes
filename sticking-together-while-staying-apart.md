# [Sticking Together while Staying Apart: Resilience in the time of global pandemic](https://desertedisland.club/agenda/#aaronaldrich)

Aaron Aldrich (Advocate @ LaunchDarkly) | @crayzeigh

## Abstract

Everything is a little bit broken all of the time. Sometimes, like recently, as in right now, the core truths and assumptions about the universe seem to be shifted out from underneath us without warning. And yet, Netflix streams movies, GitHub serves code, we all keep going and working from home and surviving. These systems, both technical and social, are resilient. And through their resilience they are able to handle all those one-in-a-million occurrences that crop up nine-times-in-ten. But what does it mean to be resilient? And further, how can we recognize and grow this resilience to better deal with the systemic surprises we're dealing with right now and in the future? What does a resilient team look like, and how do you foster that?

This talk will answer:

- What is Resilience?
- How can we create resilience in ourselves, teams and systems?
- How do our networks of systems (people, teams, organizations, applications) create resilience for each other?
- What happens when major systems and networks fail?
- How can we discover and foster resilience in our people, teams and systems?

## General Notes

- "Everything's a little bit broken all the time but it somehow keeps working"
- "Million-to-one chances crop up nine times out of ten"

## Components of Resiliency

1. Rebound
	- How quickly back to normal after a surprise
	- Work done ahead of time
1. Robustness
	- The ability to withstand and absorb well-modeleted disturbances
1. Graceful extensibility
	- The ability to stretch with challenges to operational boundaries
1. Sustained adaptability
	- Recognizing and managing adaptive capabilities over long timescales

## Bones

- Bones are constantly created and destroyed
- Bones are managed subconsciously
- Bones regrow on their own
	- If you set a bone and create good conditions for its regrowth it does much better
- Bones are naturally resilient
